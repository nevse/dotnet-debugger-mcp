# .NET Debugger for MCP

An MCP server that gives an AI agent a real .NET debugger. It attaches to a running process or
launches a program under the debugger, sets line and function breakpoints, steps, reads locals and
the call stack, and evaluates expressions in the target — the same operations a developer performs
in an IDE, exposed as tools an agent can call.

Built on [clrdbg](https://github.com/JaneySprings/clrdbg), driven over the Debug Adapter Protocol. The
debugger runs as a child process, so a crash in native debugging code costs the debug session rather
than the server.

## Requirements

The .NET 10 SDK. It provides `dnx`, and the server itself targets `net10.0`.

## Install

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add dotnet-debugger -- dotnet tool exec DotnetDebugger.Mcp --yes
```

**VS Code, Claude Desktop, or any client taking JSON:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dotnet-debugger": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["tool", "exec", "DotnetDebugger.Mcp", "--yes"]
    }
  }
}
```

There is no path to fill in and nothing to clone. The package carries the debugger and its native
shims for every platform, so the same configuration works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

`dnx DotnetDebugger.Mcp --yes` is the equivalent shorter form. Prefer `dotnet tool exec` in a client
launched from a desktop environment: `dnx` lives in the SDK directory, which such a client often does
not have on its `PATH`, while `dotnet` reliably is.

To pin a version and skip the resolution step, install it once and call the command directly:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g DotnetDebugger.Mcp
```

This needs `~/.dotnet/tools` on your `PATH`, which is the reason it is not the default suggestion.

## What it exposes

Sessions and processes: `list_dotnet_processes`, `attach_to_process`, `launch_program`,
`start_program`, `get_program_output`, `detach_from_process`, `list_sessions`, `close_session`.

Breakpoints: `set_breakpoint`, `set_function_breakpoint`, `remove_breakpoint`, `list_breakpoints`,
`set_exception_break_mode`.

Execution and inspection: `continue_execution`, `pause_execution`, `step_over`, `step_into`,
`step_out`, `wait_for_stop`, `get_process_status`, `get_stack_trace`, `get_threads`, `get_variables`,
`expand_variable`, `evaluate_expression`, `get_exception_info`.

.NET MAUI: `list_mobile_devices`, `build_mobile_app`, `launch_mobile_app` — debug an app on an
Android emulator or phone, an iOS simulator or device, or this Mac as a Mac Catalyst app, with the
same breakpoints and stepping. This needs the remote CoreCLR debugger libraries, which belong to
Visual Studio and cannot travel in this package; see
[the README](https://github.com/nevse/dotnet-debugger-mcp#debugging-a-net-maui-app) for the one-off
setup.

It also answers questions about .NET debugging internals: `search_debugging_concepts`,
`explain_icordebug_interface`, `get_debugging_flow`, `list_debugging_concepts`.

## Configuration

Every setting is optional and read from the environment — timeouts, session limits, Just My Code,
diagnostics. They are documented in the
[full README](https://github.com/nevse/dotnet-debugger-mcp#configuration).

## Origin

A fork of [decriptor/SharpDbg.MCP](https://github.com/decriptor/SharpDbg.MCP), rewritten far enough
to warrant its own name: the debugger layer speaks the Debug Adapter Protocol instead of calling a
debugger's internal API, the debugger underneath has since changed from
[SharpDbg](https://github.com/MattParkerDev/sharpdbg) to clrdbg, and launching a program under the
debugger is new.
